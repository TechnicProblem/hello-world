# hello-world
Testing GitHub.

Program that should write Hello World!

I have never used GitHub before.

macOS/Mac OS X only.

macOS Shell Script.
How to use:
Write "chmod a+x [file location]"
Then drag file into Terminal window and press enter.
This should write "Hello World!"

And yes, I know that this is not how you write a program and that this is meaningless. It is just a test of GitHub which I have never used before.
